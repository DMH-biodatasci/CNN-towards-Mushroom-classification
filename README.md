**Task:** Classification of mushrooms using convolutional neural networks. 

**Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maysee/mushrooms-classification-common-genuss-images 

**Details:** There are two genera of mushrooms that are suitable for beginners (Russula, Boletales). If you are able to recognize these two mushroom genera, there are very simple rules of thumb you can use to check whether the mushrooms are edible. The only problem is that you have to know enough to recognize the mushroom genera correctly. The neural network is supposed to help with the recognition of these mushroom genera.

**Do not eat mushrooms that you cannot identify with certainty and that you do not know for sure are edible!**
